# Student Math Score Prediction Project
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting students' **math scores** based on various features such as 
- gender
- ethnicity
- parental_level_of_education
- lunch
- test_preparation_course
- writing_score
- reading_score

  This project implements machine learning algorithms to predict math scores based on relevant features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist in understanding the factors influencing math performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)
- Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt
  Installation
## Clone the repository:
git clone
```bash
https://github.com/NextIn035846/MLProject.git
cd MLProject.git
```
## Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Flask Application:

Implement the Flask application for prediction using the trained models in the app.py file.

Run the Flask app with the command: python app.py.

Access the prediction endpoint at http://localhost:5000/predict with the required input parameters.


## Benefits
**Early Intervention:**
Identify students at risk of lower math scores early on, enabling timely intervention and support.

**Resource Optimization:**
Allocate resources efficiently by targeting specific groups or individuals based on predicted performance.

**Data-Driven Decision-Making:**
Empower educators and administrators with data-driven insights to enhance educational strategies.

**Continuous Improvement:**
Continuously refine and improve the model based on new data and evolving educational dynamics.
